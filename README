Socket Tests
------------
Socket tests are currently in the client's main function. Run the main to test.

Known Issues
------------
When running multiple files will print the following messages for each parameter:
"open() failed: No such file"
"Failed to generate map for"

The reason is due to it looping through the parameters for file names and being unable to open integers
as files.

Another known issue is that at the end of the program the following error occurs:
"Segmentation fault: (core dumped)"

We were unable to dicover the cause of this error, however it does not seem to impact the function of the
program.
