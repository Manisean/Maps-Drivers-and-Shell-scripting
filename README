Installation and Execution
--------------------------

To install compile first:

$ make

Then register an ASCII driver:

$ sudo make prog

To run the test program type:
$ ./mapdriver-test

To run the premade test type:
$ make test1
or
$ make test2

to clean the program:
$ sudo make clean-all
$ make clean

Socket Tests
------------
To run, first do make all, then start the server with ./mapserver and for client, do ./mapclient [length] [width] of desired map, ex: ./mapclient 10 10

Known Issues
------------
When running multiple files will print the following messages for each parameter:
"open() failed: No such file"
"Failed to generate map for"

The reason is due to it looping through the parameters for file names and being unable to open integers
as files.

Another known issue is that at the end of the program the following error occurs:
"Segmentation fault: (core dumped)"

We were unable to dicover the cause of this error, however it does not seem to impact the function of the
program.
